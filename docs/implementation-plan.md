# RoomLife Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the phased development strategy for RoomLife, prioritizing features by impact and organizing them into 4 main phases:

1. **Phase 1: MVP Improvements** - Movement, essential actions, item interactions (12-16 hours)
2. **Phase 2: Core Gameplay Systems** - Health, social, economy, random events (16-21 hours)
3. **Phase 3: Content Expansion** - Advanced actions, goals, expanded world (13-17 hours)
4. **Phase 4: Polish & Refinement** - Testing, balance, telemetry/metrics, UI/UX improvements (18-24 hours)

**Total estimated effort:** 59-78 hours for complete implementation

### Acceptance Criteria Framework

Each feature in this plan includes a dedicated **Acceptance Criteria** section with:
- ✓ **Measurable thresholds**: Exact values for stat changes, costs, and effects
- ✓ **Testable conditions**: Specific scenarios that must pass/fail correctly
- ✓ **Verifiable behavior**: Clear success/failure states for each feature
- ✓ **Edge cases**: Boundary conditions and error handling requirements
- ✓ **Integration points**: How features interact with existing systems

These criteria enable precise QA, automated testing, and clear definition of "done" for each feature.

## Architecture Analysis

### Current Strengths
- Clean separation of concerns (models, engine, view, IO)
- Sophisticated skill/trait system already in place
- Event logging system ready for expansion
- Schema versioning for backward compatibility
- Data-driven content via YAML files
- Deterministic RNG for testing

### Current Gaps
- 12 skills but only 6 actions (50% utilization)
- Space/Item models exist but are purely decorative
- No player agency in movement or interaction
- Limited gameplay loop (work → pay bills → repeat)
- No social gameplay despite relationship tracking
- No consequences for extreme needs

### Save Migration Strategy
- **Use defaults in loading logic** for newly added fields (e.g., `health=100`) to keep legacy saves playable, aligning with the existing schema versioning/backward compatibility guidance above.
- **Increment `schema_version`** only for breaking structure changes that cannot be safely defaulted.
- **Provide targeted data migrations** when expanding the world (new spaces/items) so older saves can be upgraded to the new content set without losing progress.

---

## UI/UX Phased Rollout Strategy

**Goal:** Introduce UI/UX improvements progressively throughout development rather than as a single late-phase effort. This prevents large UI refactors late in the plan and improves usability as core systems are built.

### Phase 1 UI/UX: Core Action Visibility (Integrated with 1.1-1.3)
**When:** Implemented alongside movement and essential actions
**What:**
- ✓ **Action filtering basics**: Only show movement actions for connected locations
- ✓ **Location-aware action display**: Filter actions by current location (e.g., shower only in bathroom)
- ✓ **Utility-aware action display**: Show/hide utility-dependent actions (shower requires water)
- ✓ **Simple cost preview**: Display basic costs for actions (e.g., "move: +2 fatigue")

**Implementation:**
- Modify `view.py` to filter actions based on location and context
- Add simple cost indicators in parentheses next to action names
- No complex UI library needed yet - basic text formatting

**Rationale:** Players need immediate feedback on what actions are available as spatial gameplay is introduced. Prevents confusion about why actions fail.

---

### Phase 2 UI/UX: Status Warnings & Feedback (Integrated with 2.1-2.4)
**When:** Implemented alongside health system and social features
**What:**
- ✓ **Basic status warnings**: Highlight critical needs with simple markers (e.g., "⚠ Hunger: 85")
- ✓ **Health warnings**: Show health status with visual indicator when below 50
- ✓ **NPC presence indicators**: Show which NPCs are at current location
- ✓ **Event formatting improvements**: Add visual separation for events in log

**Implementation:**
- Add warning symbols (⚠, ‼) to critical stats in view.py
- Simple conditional formatting for health display
- Basic event log formatting with newlines/separators
- Still no external UI dependencies

**Rationale:** Health system introduces stakes that require player awareness. Social system needs clear NPC visibility to encourage interaction.

---

### Phase 3 UI/UX: Progress & Information (Integrated with 3.1-3.2)
**When:** Implemented alongside advanced actions and goals
**What:**
- ✓ **Action details on demand**: Show detailed costs/benefits for actions (command-based or help system)
- ✓ **Goal progress display**: Show active goals with simple progress indicators
- ✓ **Skill progress indicators**: Basic progress display for skills (e.g., "Focus: 45/100")
- ✓ **Smart suggestions (basic)**: Highlight near-complete goals or urgent needs in view

**Implementation:**
- Add `help <action>` command to show detailed action info
- Display goal list with completion status
- Add progress fraction to skill display
- Simple rule-based suggestions in view model

**Rationale:** Goals system needs visibility to be effective. Players need information to make strategic decisions about skill development.

---

### Phase 4 UI/UX: Polish & Rich Formatting (4.4)
**When:** Final polish phase, after core systems complete
**What:**
- ✓ **Rich library integration**: Color-coded warnings (red/yellow/green)
- ✓ **Progress bars**: Visual progress bars for skills, goals, relationships
- ✓ **Enhanced event formatting**: Colors for positive/negative events
- ✓ **Smart suggestions (advanced)**: Context-aware recommendations with rationale
- ✓ **Action preview system**: Show projected stat changes before taking action

**Implementation:**
- Integrate Rich library for terminal formatting
- Full color scheme implementation
- Advanced view model with calculations for projections
- Comprehensive filtering and suggestion engine

**Rationale:** Core gameplay complete - now optimize for readability and user experience. Rich formatting improves comprehension without changing functionality.

---

### UI/UX Feature Toggles

To support progressive rollout and A/B testing, implement feature flags in `constants.py`:

```python
UI_FEATURES = {
    "action_filtering": True,           # Phase 1 (always enabled)
    "cost_preview": True,               # Phase 1 (always enabled)
    "status_warnings": True,            # Phase 2 (always enabled)
    "goal_progress_display": True,      # Phase 3 (always enabled)
    "rich_formatting": False,           # Phase 4 (toggle for testing)
    "smart_suggestions": False,         # Phase 4 (toggle for testing)
    "action_projections": False,        # Phase 4 (toggle for testing)
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Test features independently before full rollout
- Disable advanced UI if terminal compatibility issues arise
- Easy comparison between minimal/rich UI experiences
- Support for testing automation (disable rich formatting in tests)

## Phase 1: MVP Improvements (Immediate Gameplay Impact)

**Goal:** Make the game significantly more engaging with minimal architectural changes.

### 1.1 Movement System (Priority: HIGHEST) ⏱️ 2-3 hours

**Why First:** Unlocks spatial gameplay, very low complexity, high impact.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Add `move` action to engine.py that changes `state.world.location`
- Validate movement against `space.connections` list
- Add movement cost: fatigue +2, time advances
- Update view.py to show available exits
- Skills affected: None directly (keep simple)

**Files to modify:**
- `src/roomlife/engine.py`: Add `move` action handler
- `src/roomlife/view.py`: Add `available_exits` to view model
- `src/roomlife/constants.py`: Add movement cost constants

**Backward Compatibility:** ✅ Full - just adds new action, doesn't change state structure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✓ `move <location_id>` action successfully changes `state.world.location`
- ✓ Movement validates against `space.connections` list - invalid moves rejected with error message
- ✓ Each movement costs exactly +2 fatigue
- ✓ Each movement advances time by exactly 1 time slice
- ✓ View displays list of available exits from current location
- ✓ Attempting to move to a non-connected space returns error, does not change location
- ✓ Movement works from any starting location in existing save files
- ✓ Can chain movements: move to A, then A to B, then B to C successfully

---

### 1.2 Basic Item Interactions (Priority: HIGHEST) ⏱️ 3-4 hours

**Why Second:** Enables context-aware actions, uses existing item tags.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Create `_get_usable_items()` helper that filters items by location and tags
- Modify existing actions to require/benefit from items:
  - `sleep` requires item with "sleep" tag or +10 fatigue cost
  - `study` requires item with "study" tag or -1 skill gain
  - Add `work_from_home` that requires "work" tag desk
- Add item condition degradation on use (pristine→used→worn→broken)
- Add `maintenance` skill integration (reduces degradation)

**Files to modify:**
- `src/roomlife/engine.py`: Add item query helpers and item checks to actions
- `src/roomlife/models.py`: Add method `Item.degrade()`
- `src/roomlife/view.py`: Show which items enable which actions

**Backward Compatibility:** ✅ Full - existing saves work, items just start affecting actions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✓ `_get_usable_items()` returns only items at player's current location
- ✓ `_get_usable_items()` filters items by tag (e.g., tag="sleep" returns only sleep-tagged items)
- ✓ `sleep` action without "sleep" tag item costs +10 additional fatigue
- ✓ `study` action without "study" tag item reduces skill gain by exactly -1 point
- ✓ `work_from_home` action requires item with "work" tag, fails if not present
- ✓ Item degradation follows exact sequence: pristine → used → worn → broken
- ✓ Each use of an item triggers degradation check
- ✓ Maintenance skill level ≥ 50 reduces degradation probability by 50%
- ✓ Broken items do not count as usable for action requirements
- ✓ View shows which items enable/enhance specific actions at current location
- ✓ Existing save files with pristine items load correctly and degrade normally

---

### 1.3 Essential Daily Actions (Priority: HIGH) ⏱️ 4-6 hours ✅ COMPLETED

**Why Third:** Fills critical gameplay gaps, utilizes underused skills.

**New Actions to Add:**

#### 1. shower (location: bath_001)
- Hygiene: +40
- Mood: +5
- Warmth: -10 (if no heat)
- Water required
- Skill gain: None (basic need)

#### 2. cook_basic_meal (requires kettle or stove)
- Hunger: -35 (better than charity rice)
- Mood: +3
- Cost: 300 pence (ingredients)
- Skill gain: nutrition +1.5
- Creativity trait bonus: +10% hunger reduction

#### 3. clean_room

- Hunger: +5
- Mood: +10
- Energy: +5 (long-term)
- Skill gain: reflexivity +2.5
- Fitness trait bonus: -20% fatigue cost

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Add each action in `apply_action()` with similar pattern to existing actions
- Use `state.world.location` to gate location-specific actions
- Check `state.utilities.water` for shower
- Query items for cook action
- If 1.2 is not yet implemented, allow `cook_basic_meal` to fall back to a no-item-required version (temporary behavior) so Phase 1.3 can land first without blocking on item gating.

**Files to modify:**
- `src/roomlife/engine.py`: Add 4 new action handlers
- `src/roomlife/view.py`: Filter actions by location/context
- `src/roomlife/constants.py`: Add action costs/benefits

**Backward Compatibility:** ✅ Full - just adds new actions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**shower action:**

## Phase 2: Core Gameplay Systems (Depth & Consequences)

**Goal:** Add systems that create meaningful choices and consequences.

### 2.1 Health & Consequences System (Priority: HIGH) ⏱️ 3-4 hours

**Why:** Makes needs matter, adds stakes to gameplay.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Add `health: int` field to Needs (0-100)
- Health degrades when extreme needs occur:
  - Hunger > 80: health -2 per turn, fatigue +5
  - Fatigue > 90: health -1 per turn, all actions +50% cost
  - Hygiene < 20: health -1 per turn, mood -5
  - Warmth < 30: health -3 per turn, fatigue +5
  - Stress > 80: health -1 per turn, mood -5
- Health below 50: All skill gains -50%
- Health below 30: New action `visit_doctor` (costs 5000 pence, restores 30 health)
- Health 0: "Game Over" state (can continue but with severe penalties)

**Files to modify:**
- `src/roomlife/models.py`: Add `health` to Needs
- `src/roomlife/engine.py`: Add `_apply_health_consequences()` called from `_apply_environment()`
- `src/roomlife/io.py`: Add health to save/load (default 100 for old saves)

**Backward Compatibility:** ⚠️ Semi-compatible - add `health=100` default in load function.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✓ `health` field added to Needs dataclass with range 0-100
- ✓ Health initializes to 100 for new games
- ✓ Old save files load with health defaulting to 100

- ✓ Warmth < 30 causes exactly -3 health per turn
- ✓ Warmth < 30 causes exactly +5 fatigue per turn
- ✓ Stress > 80 causes exactly -1 health per turn
- ✓ Stress > 80 causes exactly -5 mood per turn
- ✓ Health < 50 reduces all skill gains by exactly 50%
- ✓ Health < 30 unlocks `visit_doctor` action
- ✓ `visit_doctor` costs exactly 5000 pence (fails if insufficient)
- ✓ `visit_doctor` restores exactly +30 health
- ✓ Health cannot exceed 100 or drop below 0
- ✓ Health = 0 displays "Critical Health" warning but allows continued play
- ✓ Health = 0 applies severe penalties to all actions (e.g., doubled costs)
- ✓ All health consequences apply in `_apply_environment()` call

- Events can be:
  - Time-gated (only certain time slices)
  - Location-gated (only in certain spaces)
  - Requirement-gated (needs NPC, skill level, etc.)
- Roll for events in `_apply_environment()` with 3-8% chance per turn

**Files to modify:**
- `src/roomlife/constants.py`: Add RANDOM_EVENTS list

---

### 3.2 Goals & Progression System (Priority: LOW-MEDIUM) ⏱️ 5-6 hours

**Why:** Gives players direction, sense of achievement.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Add Goal system:
  ```python
  @dataclass
  class Goal:
      goal_id: str
      description: str
      conditions: Dict  # e.g., {"skill.focus": 50}
      reward: Dict  # e.g., {"money_pence": 5000}
      completed: bool = False
  ```
- Predefined goal tree:

## Architectural Trade-offs & Decisions

### Trade-off 1: Action System Architecture
**Current:** String-based actions in big if/elif block
**Alternatives:** Action class hierarchy, registry/plugin system, command pattern

**✅ Recommendation:** Keep current system for now
**Reasoning:** Simple, works well for ~20 actions, easy to understand, can refactor later if needed (beyond 30-40 actions)

---

### Trade-off 2: Item System Complexity
**Option A:** Simple tags + effects (current approach)
**Option B:** Full component system (items have behaviors, states)

**✅ Recommendation:** Start with Option A, expand gradually
**Reasoning:** Tags already exist, avoid premature abstraction, easy to iterate

---

### Trade-off 3: NPC System
**Option A:** Lightweight (relationships + schedules)
**Option B:** Full NPC simulation (needs, actions, AI)

**✅ Recommendation:** Option A for Phase 2, expand in Phase 3+
**Reasoning:** Focus on player experience first, keep scope manageable

---

### Trade-off 4: Save File Migration Strategy
**Option A:** Strict versioning with migration functions
**Option B:** Flexible loading with defaults for missing fields

**✅ Recommendation:** Option B (current approach)
**Reasoning:** Already working well, dataclass defaults handle missing fields, less maintenance

---

### Trade-off 5: Content Management
**Option A:** Hardcoded in constants.py
**Option B:** YAML files in data/
**Option C:** Database/content system

**✅ Recommendation:** Use Option B for data, Option A for tuning
**Reasoning:** Actions/costs/formulas in constants.py, Items/spaces/NPCs in YAML

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Feature Creep
**Mitigation:** Stick to phased plan, complete Phase 1 fully before Phase 2

### Risk 2: Balance Issues
**Mitigation:** Build simulation/testing tools early (Phase 4.1), iterate on constants

### Risk 3: Save Compatibility Breaking
**Mitigation:** Test loading old saves after each change, use schema_version for breaking changes

### Risk 4: Action Space Too Large
**Mitigation:** Context-aware action filtering in view.py, don't show unavailable actions

### Risk 5: Code Complexity Growth
**Mitigation:** Keep engine.py focused on logic, extract helpers, maintain test coverage

## Critical Files for Implementation

The 5 most critical files for this implementation plan:

1. **`src/roomlife/engine.py`** - Core action processing logic; will receive the most additions (movement, items, social, health, all new actions). Every feature touches this file.

2. **`src/roomlife/constants.py`** - Game balance and content definitions; needs expansion for action costs, shop items, events, and tuning parameters.

3. **`src/roomlife/models.py`** - Data structures; needs additions for NPCs, goals, health, and expanded state.

4. **`src/roomlife/view.py`** - View model generation; must expose new systems to UI (NPCs, goals, available actions, health warnings).

5. **`data/items.yaml`** - Content database; needs expansion for all new items, will drive variety in gameplay.

---

## Next Steps

To begin implementation:

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Set up development branch
3. Start with Phase 1.1 (Movement System)
4. Implement features in recommended order
5. Test after each phase
6. Iterate on balance as needed

Happy coding! 🎮
